## Objective <br>
Using the titanic machine learning dataset from kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview", predict the survival of passengers based on specific variables. <br>
For learning purposes, this project is done in order to gain familiarity with machine learning basics and overall the workflow, from data exploration, data preprocessing, to model building and evaluation. <br>

## Data <br>

The data is split into two separate files: <br>
    - train.csv <br>
    - test.csv <br>

The train dataset is used for data exploration and feature engineering. The train and test dataset contain features such as passenger class, gender, fare and age. Only the train dataset contains the ground truth (survival of each passenger), while the test dataset does not. Additional features can be created using existing ones. The model(s) are built and trained using the train dataset and evaluated based key metrics pertaining to classification models. <br>

The test dataset is used to generate predictions from the model built using the train dataset. The test dataset predictions are then saved into a csv file to be submitted to Kaggle to get an accuracy score and leaderboard placement
